   <h1>Bloom Of Thoughts</h1>
   <p>â€œMen fear thought as they fear nothing else on earth<br>
     more than ruin, more even than death.<br> 
     Thought is subversive and revolutionary, destructive and terrible,<br>
      thought is merciless to privilege, established institutions,<br>
      and comfortable habits; thought is anarchic and lawless,<br> 
      indifferent to authority, careless of the well-tried wisdom of the ages.<br>
       Thought looks into the pit of hell and is not afraid<br>
        Thought is great and swift and free, the light of the<br>
         world, and the chief glory of man."</p>
